Group 1 Project for STAT400 @ CSU

To run the code:

1.) Run the libraries, install if necessary

2.) Run the entire first block. Lines 15-230 are us setting up the functions. Lines 231-245 are setting up the testing parameters, you can change these and play around with it. Lines 247-291 will create the plots for the simulation.

3) The last code chunk will look at each day an whether the people were susceptible, infected, or recovered.
