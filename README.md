Group 1 Project for STAT400 @ CSU

To run the code in Paper.Rmd:

1.) Load the libraries, install if necessary

2.) Run the entire first code chunk. Lines 14-260 set up the functions. 

3) The last two code chunks give plots for different mean crucial distances and vaccination rates, respectively. These can take some time to run, especially the first chunk.
